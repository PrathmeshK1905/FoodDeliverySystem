I've created a folder named pages and it contains different aspects like Cart, Home, PlaceOrder.
Each of these contains a jsx and css file. jsx file contains structure (html and imports) and css is styling.
Everything works so far but the last part where if I click on food items a border appears is not working in our website(Refer to timestamp: [55:00] onwards).
Rest everything until then runs fine haven't really committed anything so probably goona be a big commit.
Time remaining: [About 9hours]
