I've created a folder named pages and it contains different aspects like Cart, Home, PlaceOrder.
Each of these contains a jsx and css file. jsx file contains structure (html and imports) and css is styling.
Everything works so far but the last part where if I click on food items a border appears is not working in our website(Refer to timestamp: [55:00] onwards).
Rest everything until then runs fine haven't really committed anything so probably goona be a big commit.

I've added the display items and food display components. The latest part was creating the counter for the food item one selects. 
However, the way we have created it is not the optimal way, so the next part of the vedio talks about making it better, by creating some object. 
You can follow along.
