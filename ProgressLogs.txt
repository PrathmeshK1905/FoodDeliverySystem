You should start at: [55:00]
I've created a folder named pages and it contains different aspects like Cart, Home, PlaceOrder.
Each of these contains a jsx and css file. jsx file contains structure (html and imports) and css is styling.
Everything works so far but the last part where if I click on food items a border appears is not working in our website(Refer to timestamp: [55:00] onwards).
Rest everything until then runs fine haven't really committed anything so probably goona be a big commit.

I've added the display items and food display components. The latest part was creating the counter for the food item one selects. 
However, the way we have created it is not the optimal way, so the next part of the vedio talks about making it better, by creating some object. 
You can follow along.

Done with the login and registration(sign in) logic using the frontend and also implememted other funtionalities.
To be done:
1. Resolve login in error.
Have sign in with 3 accounts as   > email: Prahtmesh@gmail.com , Password: Prathmesh; > email: Aarya@gmail.com , Password: Aarya1234; > email: Vaishali@gmail.com , Password: Vaishali
You can use them. 
2. Add all the food items to database. Now our progam takes the food items from the db and not from assets folder. So at present, the db has only 1 item, as a result of with only one item is being displayed on the page.
Highly recomemded: Please watch the whole vedio from 5:51:20 time stamp and check the code side by side.
Time remaining : [3 hours 2 mins]

Note: Always before you start writing your project, start the backend server using "npm run server"
and the frontend server using "npm run dev" by opening the internal terminal of each of them.
